I use "git clone https://github.com/cours-esilv/lab-git-ci.git" in the file that I created for the TP1.
Then I modified the identity.md file with "nano identity.md". After that, I use "git add identity.md" 
to add the identity.md to the commit. Then I use "git commit -m "Entered the details"" and 
"git push origin main" (in order to locate the branch, I use "git branch".
